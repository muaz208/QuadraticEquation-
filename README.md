# QuadraticEquation-

This was a simple yet fun project to make. In high school, I would be using the quadratic equation almost everyday and more multiple courses as well and the fact that my calculator could not calculate roots for quadratic functions made many homework and test problems take much longer than they needed to due to time being spent to manually calculate the roots by hand. That's when I thought it would be a great idea to code the quadratic equation in Python to help me save time and be more efficient with my time.

This program will calculate the roots of any quadratic equation and will tell the user how many roots there are (if any) and what those roots are. This program also accommodates for incorrect inputs and asks the user to re-enter their values.
